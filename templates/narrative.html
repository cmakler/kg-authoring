        <h2>Optimal Consumption</h2>
        <p>For each of the following utility functions, let's solve for the optimal consumption of Good 1 and Good 2 for
            general prices $p_1$ and $p_2$ and general income $m$.</p>

        <h3>Perfect Substitutes</h3>
        <p>Let's think of a situation in which the consumer likes Good 1 half as much as Good 2:
            $$u(x_1,x_2) = x_1 + 2x_2$$
            This utility function does NOT satisfy the conditions for using the Lagrange method, since the indifference
            curves cross the axes and are also not strictly convex. So, we have to apply logic.</p>

            element, which by default are constrained to the main
            column. Don’t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside
            the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of
            discussion, like so:</p>
        <figure class="fullwidth">
            <div id="diagramDiv3" class="kg-container" src="../json/budget.json"></div>
        </figure>
