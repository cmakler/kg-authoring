        <h1>Scarcity and Choice</h1>
        <p>At its core, economics is about the choices we face -- as a individuals, or as part of a firm, or as a
            society. We have at our disposal various resources (time, money) and various ways to spend those
            resources.</p>
        <p>Because resources are scarce, any choice we make automatically has an <strong><label-for id="oppcost">opportunity cost.Spending an hour studying means spending one hour less watching television, and vice versa; so the act of choosing to spend more resources on one good necessitates the act of </p>

        <h2>A simple choice: which candy to buy</h2>
        <p>The budget constraint partitions the available choice space into affordable and unaffordable choices. The
            standard budget constraint for $n$ goods may be written as
            $$p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 + \cdots + p_nx_n \le m$$
            where $p_i$ is the price of good $i$, and $x_i$ is the quantity of good $i$. More generally, using vector
            notation, we can write this constraint as a dot product:
            $$\vec{p} \cdot \vec{x} \le m$$
            where $\vec{p} = [p_1,p_2,...p_n]$ is a vector of the prices of $n$ goods, and $\vec{x} = [x_1,x_2,...,x_n]$
            is a vector of quantities of $n$ goods.
        </p>
        <p>Note that each of the terms in this constraint is measured in dollars: for each good $i$, the term $p_ix_i$
            represents the expenditure on good $i$:$$\overbrace{\underbrace{p_i}_\frac{\text{dollars}}{\text{units of
            i}} \times \underbrace{x_i}_\text{units of i}}^\text{dollars}$$</p>

        <h2>The budget line for two goods</h2>
        <p>Visually, it's useful to constrain ourselves to two goods, since that's easy to plot. In Good 1 - Good 2
            space, the "budget line" $p_1x_1 + p_2x_2 = m$ partitions Good 1 - Good 2 space into the set of affordable
            bundles (beneath the budget line) and the set of unaffordable bundles (above the budget line). All bundles
            \textit{along} the budget line cost the same amount, and exhaust the available income $m$. For example, in
            the two-good case with $p_1 = 18$, $p_2 = 6$, and $m = 54$, the budget line would be
            $$18x_1 + 6x_2 = 54$$
            which we can plot in Good 1 - Good 2 space as follows:
        </p>
        <figure class="fullwidth">
            <div id="diagramDiv3" class="kg-container" src="json/budget.json"></div>
        </figure>
        <p>Figures should try to use the <code>figure</code> element, which by default are constrained to the main
            column. Donâ€™t wrap figures in a paragraph tag. Any label or margin note goes in a regular margin note inside
            the figure. For example, most of the time one should introduce a figure directly into the main flow of
            discussion, like so:</p>
